# Bayesian-Linear-Regression
Bayesian modeling turns raw sensor noise into useful confidence information, enabling smarter, adaptive motion control — not just for robotics, but for every precision manufacturing system where microns matter.

## Ensuring Linear Motion Accuracy in Machine Tools with Bayesian Curve Modeling

In precision machining, even a small deviation from a linear trajectory can lead to tolerance errors or poor surface quality. To tackle this, we can apply Bayesian curve modeling — a probabilistic approach that continuously learns from sensor feedback to maintain motion accuracy.
